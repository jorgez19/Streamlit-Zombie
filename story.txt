In the early 2030s, the city of New York was hit by a deadly outbreak that left a trail of devastation in its wake. The source of the outbreak was traced back to an experimental food additive developed by a large food corporation.

The additive, designed to increase the shelf life of food, had undergone extensive testing before being released to the public. However, those who consumed it began experiencing extreme aggression and violence, leading to the rapid spread of the virus throughout the city.

Despite attempts to contain the outbreak, it soon spread beyond the city limits, infecting other towns and cities and causing widespread panic and chaos.

Governments around the world have since taken steps to improve food safety regulations and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The outbreak serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with untested and unregulated products in the food industry.
